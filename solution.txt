Q. What is the difference between git stash apply and git stash pop?
Ans- Both the commands are for reapplying the uncommitted changes to files, git stash apply will reapply the latest change from the stash list without harming the stashed change. Whereas the git stash pop command will apply the latest change from the stash list by taking it out of the list and then applying it. We can use the git stash apply command multiple times for reapplying the same change to different branches but we can only use git stash pop command once.
